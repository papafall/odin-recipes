        Add onions, bell peppers, and 1 tablespoon curry powder to the skillet
        and sauté for 2 minutes. Add zucchini and mushrooms to the skillet;
        sauté for 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return tofu to the skillet, add 1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to
        taste, and mix well. Pour in coconut milk, stir well. Reduce heat to
        low, cover, and let simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and
        pepper.
