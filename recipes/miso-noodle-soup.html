      <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons finely grated garlic</li>
      <li>⅓ cup thinly sliced leek (green part)</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
      <li>½ cup enoki mushrooms</li>
      <li>4 ounces refrigerated fresh ramen noodles</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons miso paste</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crack eggs into a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook until outer
        edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Turn once; cook until whites are
        completely set, about 3 minutes; set eggs aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir ginger,
        garlic, leek, cabbage, and mushrooms until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        Stir in miso paste; gradually whisk in water and bring to a boil. Add in
        ramen noodles; reduce heat and simmer until noodles soften, about 3
        minutes. Season with soy sauce. Divide into two bowls; top each serving
        with egg. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions.
